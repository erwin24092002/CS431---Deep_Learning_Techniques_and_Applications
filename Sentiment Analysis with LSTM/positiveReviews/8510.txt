I love this ! Its really a place for everyone . It now starting to get decorated for Lunar_New_Year . It going to be filled with beautiful flowers . If you like to do ppl watching . Here the place .
It have all kind of ppl here . From young to old , rich to poor . They have all kind of street food on the side of street , and just one step away to five stars restaurants . They have performance from local artist . It a fun place to spend your night .
