A local watering hole , popular with the regulars for a game of darts and pool . The atmosphere is homely and the staffs are friendly . Live bands on evenings of Wednesdays to Saturdays on the upstairs area . If you rather a quiet drink with friends , then downstairs is a better option . The food quality is also good - I had the curry grilled wings & the grill sanma fish with kimchi side . Overall , recommended to go and have a drink , and make some new friends .
