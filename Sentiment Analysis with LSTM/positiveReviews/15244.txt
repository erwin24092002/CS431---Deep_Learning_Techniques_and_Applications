Arrived_Da_Nang ,
The first place I intended to go was this particular place . I ordered the wrap which was named " Bánh_cuốn heo 2 đầu da " , as well as beef . Also , the Bánh_bèo was also ordered . In general , the food was extremely good with tender meat as well as good shrimp paste . Even though the wifi is not available . , but surrounding environment was rated as good ( warm family surrounding ) . Beside , the service was extremely good which I was expected when I travelled to Da_Nang . In particular , the way of the waiter treat us was like king . Anyway , the experience in this place was good with an average price and I will be come back soon .
