Like it alot . It tucked in a conner . Almost miss it driving by .
Place was clean , nicely decorated . Staff was friendly . I went with my cousins , they take a while to order . But the staff didnt mind at all .
It only have a few seat down stair so went upstair to check it out . We havent say anything yet but the staff already got it . He ran up stair and got it ready .
Ice cream came out good . Good place for family hang out , a lit pricy for just ice cream tho .
