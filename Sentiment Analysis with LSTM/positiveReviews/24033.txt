There are very few western eateries in SaiGon that have high quality and reasonable prices . Bon_Appetit is one such place .
Small restaurant in a good location ; cozy atmosphere . Steak with green pepper sauce is one of the best steak i ' ve had in Saigon . Sauces are as well as good . Salads can be better but still taste fresh .
Home made desserts ( creme brulee . . ) were really excellent
