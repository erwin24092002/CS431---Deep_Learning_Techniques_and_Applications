Good food , romantic view and super friendly staffs ! Must go again ...
One thing I ' d suggest is to have a separate phone line since the number on foody couldnt b reached after 5pm . I wanted to change my reservation time but nobody picked up the phone ...
I didn ' t get to take pix of the other dishes I ordered so here ' s all I ' ve got !
