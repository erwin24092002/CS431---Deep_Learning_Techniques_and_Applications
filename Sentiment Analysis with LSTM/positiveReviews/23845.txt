Soory I can ' t write in Vietnamese , but I loved this restaurant . It has a beautiful courtyard garden and it ' s so romantic with lanterns hanging from the fruit trees and the elegant setting was special . We had wine and food from the special Liguria menu , it was delicious , the Vietnamese and Italian staff are very friendly and made us feel very welcome . We also had grappa and it was so good . What I liked best is the relaxed atmosphere . It was well priced as the quality of service and food was superb .
