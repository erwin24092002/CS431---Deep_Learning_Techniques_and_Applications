The 200k buffet is really worth it ! Good meat , fresh veggies , nice way of seasoning and really good service .
My boyfriend and I went there tonight for dinner and we mostly had to roll back home in happiness ! We rarely give tips in Hanoi but tonight we did give the waitress some tips because she deserved it , well done to the team !
