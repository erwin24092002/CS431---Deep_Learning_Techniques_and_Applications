We had high expectations of this place and my word boy oh boy i was not disappointed !
Been a restaurant inside Vincom the interior was nice and spacious , good air conditioning system to keep customers cool , and free wi fi .
We were shown to our table and had a lovely waitress named ' kim hoa ' who took her time explaining the different meats within the menu and providing recommendations - very impressed !
We ordered 4 serves of meats , a korean glass noodle , korean pancake , 4 drinks and at the end , 2 panna cottas .
The service , as i mentioned , was very very good . I do not want to make a big deal but if you get a choice , make sure to ask for ' Kim_Hoa ' to be your waitress . She was helpful with the menu , cooked our meats for us , and basically was at our beg and call the whole meal !
The meats - very good and trimmed , of course at a price ! Cooked well with good flavours and seasoning , it was worth every dollar !
The korean glass noodle is very good , great flavours with good amounts of ingredients , but a bit heavy of the sesame oil .
The korean pancake was a surprise - i expected it to be average ( not a keen fan of it ) , but this pancake was nice , thick and well seasoned - it was actually nice to eat !
The drinks were on the whole good , my lemon soda was poor - too much soda not enough lemon .
The panna cottas - kiwi and raspberry , were very nice and well priced at 18k , absolute bargain given its quality !
All in all , a 11/10 for service and a high rating for the food and everything else - definitely will be back on my next visit !
