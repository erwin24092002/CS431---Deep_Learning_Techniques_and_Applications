The space is decorated perfectly inside out the high - class and romantic theme . The enchanting background music just adds on to the brilliant setting of the café . The cakes and tea are amazing . And on top of it all , the service brings the utmost pleasure to customers . For such a reasonable price , I recommend this place to all food lovers .
It ' s a real shame I don ' t live in Da_Nang , but I wish your business prosperity , and hopefully , I will get to visit your café once again the day I come back to Da_Nang to enjoy all of your goodie foodie . : )
Cheers to the Chef and his lady .
