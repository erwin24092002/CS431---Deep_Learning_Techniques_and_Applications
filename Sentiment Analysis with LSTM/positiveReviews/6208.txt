On some lazy days , we was at home and nothing to ate . Decided to come down to Gangnam bulgogi restaurant . Ordered a beef bulgogi rice and bibimbap , all comes with free side dish . A rice or noodles set cost around 5 usd . Specially like side dish in this place , everytime i visit is so nice and super yummy . Me and my sister ordered 2 rice dish and damage 250.000 VND for 2 ( includes one drink ) . Highly recommend this restaurant for everyone want to have satisfy and full - filling meal
