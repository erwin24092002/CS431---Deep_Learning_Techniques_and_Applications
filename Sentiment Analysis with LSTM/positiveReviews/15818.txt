I have tried pasta in many different areas in Ho_Chi_Minh_City but I prefer Pasta_Food the most for its distinctive taste . The chef is sociable and willing to show me the recipes I have been looking for . I can tell I will have no hesitation in recommending this Food_Shop to my friends and colleagues . I will pay this place a regular visit to try different dishes of the chef . In the new year of 2016 , I wish you do a good business and stay healthy to deliver us more exotic foods that we have not tried anywhere before . Good job Pasta_Good .
