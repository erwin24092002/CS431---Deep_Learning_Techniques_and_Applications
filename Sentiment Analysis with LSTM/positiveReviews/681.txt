I don ' t just love Dream_Coffee , I ' m IN love with Dream_Coffee . If cafes and humans could copulate and make more cafes , I would marry Dream_Coffee , have dozens of cafe - babies and live happily ever after .
Seriously though . The coffee drinks are delicious ( particularly the hot and iced coconut , as well as the egg coffee ) , the food is simple , delicious and cheeeeeap . I get my entire breakfast ( Coffee , eggs , bread and diced cucumber )   for under $ 2 . Sometimes I add fresh fruit and yoghurt for another $ 1.50 .
  The staff is extremely friendly and responsive ... they occassionally forget to bring something out , but you can always remind them easily . I ' ve worked in a cafe . Sometimes you forget things . It ' s not a problem .
The space is cozy , antiquated and hip . Honestly , I would work for this business . They ' re amazing , and cheap compared to other similar quality cafes in Hai_Phong . Great job ! Keep it up !
