I ordered matcha crepe cake last month , cause it was my beloved brother ' s birthday . And today I ordered cheesecake , cause it was my grandma ' s birthday ! Result ? It was awesome ! ! Really , at first I kinda thought the price was little . . ( ^ - ^ ) but after eating it , I really thought it is reasonable price ! The decoration was simple but cute and the taste was really awesome . . ≧ ﹏ ≦
I think I ' ll order whenever I need cakes ! Every birthday of my family and friends for sure ∩ _ _ ∩
One thing , I think the size of cake box could be a little more smaller might look better . The size of cake was kinda small but compared to that the box was kinda huge : : > _ < : :
Anyway , thanks for tasty cakes !
