My wife and I had a retrospective wedding photo shoot done by the Lavender_Studio at Saigon .
The experience overall was excellent , with the final product been a work of art .
The pricing is very reasonable for what you get and the professionalism of the team there .
We did not have any formal wear and they were able to organise this for us - but not without dramas - they did not have a shirt for me and their shoes were a bit tardy .
However , the professionalism and skills of the make up artist and photographers can not be faulted .
Overall , a very happy and satisfied customer !
