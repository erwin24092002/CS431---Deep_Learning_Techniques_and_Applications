I discovered this coffee shop while i was finding some where to relax . The menu look good , they have many kind of drinks to choose : vietnamese , italian coffee , milkshake , freeze . . they also have sugarless drinks . I tried cappucino and it was so nice . I sat on 2nd floor , it has a good view that i could take a look to whole Han river . This coffee shop is a good place to relax after a long day .
