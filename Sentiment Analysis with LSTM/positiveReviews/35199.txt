It all started years ago with a stroll around town to do some sight seeing . I stumbled into this place after noticing the crowds on my morning walks . It ' s been a wrap eversince .
Places that only have a few options on the menu are a plus because that means the food is always fresh . Here you can either choose to have Pho or Bun_Bo_Hue as your meal . The_Pho was very good , so I ordered the Bun_Bo_Hue to-go for lunch later that day .
Fast-forward to now and the quality has still remained spectacular . The owner always has a smile on his face and you can tell he appreciates his customers , which is rare for a place that stays this busy . The food here makes me happy and letting everbody know is the purpose for the review .
