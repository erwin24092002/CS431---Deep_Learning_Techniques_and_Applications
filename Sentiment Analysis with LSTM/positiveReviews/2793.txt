Visiting_Da_Nang frequently but this is the first time I have found a coffee shop which has a creative design ( korean style ) . I like it . 😍 I came with VNese friends . They told me a lot of good things about this place , so i wanna try . One thing make me suprised is Batbingsu . Their_Bingsu is so good although it is not as delicious as my country . 😜 but with 60,000 vnd , i think it is so cheap for a Batbingsu . My friend drank ice blend coffee . I also tried 😊 i think i fall in love with matcha ice blend in Liferia . Really really love this taste . 😍 the next time to Da_Nang , I will come back . Nice coffee shop in Da_Nang . 👍
