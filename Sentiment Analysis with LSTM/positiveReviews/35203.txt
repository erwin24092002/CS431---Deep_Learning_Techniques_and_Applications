This restaurant is tucked away in the side streets , it is very open plan and spacious , although has private dining areas which are a lot more peaceful and quieter , especially when you have karaoke on !
Beautiful food , meats very tender and well marinated ! The cockles had a beautiful flavour and the fried rice was seasoned well .
All in all , great dining option for sit down dinner at a very reasonable price !
