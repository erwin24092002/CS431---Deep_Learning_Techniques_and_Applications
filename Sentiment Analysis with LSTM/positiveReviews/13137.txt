The staff ( both Vietnamese and Japanese ) there are just amazing ! They are all thougthful , attentive , friendly and professional . Service is spotless . I get an amazing ombre hair color . My lovely Japanese hairdresser understood what my wants in 2 minutes and I actually get what I wanted . I felt sorry because I arrived quite late and the whole coloring lasted more than 3 hours but they did still provide a wonderful service , even though I was the last customer and left the salon 1 and a hald hour after they usually close .
I ' ll be back for sure !
