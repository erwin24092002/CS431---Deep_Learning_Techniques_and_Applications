This is such an amazing local restaurant which serves with exotic beef meat . I am always very impressed and satisfied with the food quality and pricing range . If you are wondering where you should take your dinner , then this is just the right place you should be . Come once and you will come back for sure , not only because of the high quality of food , but also the attentive service and friendly smile plus warm welcome of the owner and her brothers
