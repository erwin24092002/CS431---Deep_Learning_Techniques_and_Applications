Being tired of all the PMH overproced sushi places we decided to give this one a try . We ordered just about everything we could have wanted , and it was still less that 150,000 vnd each person . Especially amazing were the takoyaki balls . But also , just as good , were the maki hand roll , salmon nigiri , and a few various special rolls . Not much of a place inside , but the have parking , good food , cheap beer , and a great price .
