Located near the beach of the Hoian , this is vegetarian restaurant has a nice setting . The food is delicious with reasonable price . They have variety dishes to serve . You must try the soup . It ' s super delicious . Besides the main menu is good too . The desert is good as the main course in my opinion . The staff is friendly . I will come back again and again .
