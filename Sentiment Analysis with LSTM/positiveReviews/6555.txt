As a mom of three , I know how tired it could be when you are pregant . Finding a place where you could have a safe , professional maternity spa , is always a trick . So once I know the PNP , not only the spa is clean , comfortable , professional but they also have a kids zone for my kid to play when I am having a massage . Best thing is that after the massage , I could just go down to the tea house , have a pot if hot Macaroon tea , small dessert . The price is really affordable , would totally come back .
