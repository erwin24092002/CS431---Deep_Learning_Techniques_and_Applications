Coffee dream meets all the needs for an awesome hangout spot !
We ' re talking tasty food , savory and sweet snacks , cool drinks , hot drinks , fruity smoothies , fresh jucies , and good coffee . The staff speak some English and are very friendly . If there is a mistake or a problem , they are always happy to work with you !
I personally LOVE the banh mi chao and order it every time . They give you a plentiful amount of bread and I am always satiffied and full at the end of the meal .
Coffee_Dream is also among one of the most affordable cafes in Hai_Phong for the quality , so there is nothing not to like .
