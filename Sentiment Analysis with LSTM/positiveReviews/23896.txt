Come to the place on Sunday afternoon and at 5 : 30pm ... . it ' s so early for a pub and it ' s so early for the place as well coz it open at 6pm on Sunday . The place is nice , it is decorated as graffiti on the streets .
I tried cube beef and seafood fried rice , both of them are delicious and especially chips , really strange taste from others ... it tastes like cookies ... !
Recommend for young people .
