Beautiful_Hawaii themed resort . We especially enjoyed the various pool areas and spa at the resort was very reasonably priced . A spa package starts at $ 40 USD for a full body massage and facial ! We had an amazing oceanfront room . It was huge !
However food menu was limited to western items , but that ' s okay because we ventured out to eat .
