Has been here twice for lunch . Dishes were so delicious but at acceptable price for such a beautiful and good - service restaurant like May . For a set lunch ( 200k + + / pax ) , there are a variety of choices for starter , main course and dessert . As I cannot eat too rich dishes so I prefer Asian style dishes to Western style dishes . The dessert was so tasty and I felt like it must be much better than in any other shops specialied in sweets and cakes . Below are some images of my lunch sets .
- Set 1 : Crab_Balls , Fried chicken breast with sweet and sour sauce / Rolled pork with vegetable , Panna cotta
- Set 2 : Avocado salad , Asian_Salmon , Tiramisu
