This is the kind of food that you want to eat when you are incredibly hungry .  
I first tried the sausage salad with pickles . A little bit too much pickle for me , but the cheese was delicious , which tastes exactly like the Emmi cheese back at my home in Europe .  
My favourite dishes were the cordon blue , a typical french dish which consits of pork wrapped up around ham and cheese , with a lighlty fried bread crumb coating . The veal snitzel served on typical German sour krout was delicious . And so was the veal in creamy mushroom sauce with crispy frien " Rosti "
But my No . 1 dish was the fondue . It was great sharing with friends , dipping break and hams and vegetables in cheese , which the chef calls a " secret mix " . This dish goes beautifully with a glass of white wine .
Cheers_Chef !
