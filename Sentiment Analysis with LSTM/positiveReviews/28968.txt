Given last time it was so good i could not resist but to return a second time - and yes , we were equally pleased as the first time !
We had the pleasure of sitting at the sunken table - a japanese tradition - and as it was separate to the main dining area it felt almost like a private room !
The only downside to the decor and interior is that , let me know if i am wrong , but there does not appear to be a smoke free dining area ? So of course japanese men as they like to have a smoke , you could smell it a bit but thankfully we were in the separate dining area .
We ordered 3 x maki rolls - californian , eel and cucumber , and shrimp - all 3 rolls were super delicious and i can not fault the presentation , texture or taste !
We also ordered 2 x beef teriyaki , 2 x beef tongue and 2 x fried chicken - the reason why we ordered 2 x those items was because they are that good you just can not have 1 serve only !
The fried chicken - made to order - beautiful , hot , all chicken and no fat , 10 / 10 !
The beef tongue again was sauteed nicely and was oh so soft and tender .
The beef teriyaki - first serve a little chewy ( little over cooked ) but second serve was super tender and juicy . The glaze of teriyaki sauce was oh so yum , it is simply devine . Only other criticism was that there was a bit more chewy fat on the beef compared to last visit .
For drinks there was a cocktail x 1 and japanese tea x 3 .
All in all , another wonderful fine japanese dining experience . Can not wait til we returned to come visit again !
