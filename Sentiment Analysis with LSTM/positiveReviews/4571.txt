This is a great restaurant serving Vietnamese and a few European dishes as well as yummy pastries ! The restaurant is a training ground for students of Hoa_Sua_School for disadvantaged youth - a non profit school that teaches kids from a variety of difficult circumstances cullinary , pastry and hospitality management skills . The food is delicious , affordable , and the students working there are awesome ! Definitely a place worth supporting before or after exploring the ethnology museum .
