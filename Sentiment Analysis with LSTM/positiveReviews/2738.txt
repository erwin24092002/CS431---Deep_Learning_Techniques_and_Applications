We came here for lunch the other day . Its a great place for a mid afternoon snack , but the portipns are not very big . But the price is right for it . The curry is about 30,000 VND and it comes with bread as well . Most drinks and smoothies are around 25,000 VND . The staff at the restaurant are very friendly and know a little english . The atmosphere is awesome here the restaurant holds about 20 people maybe a little more . The owner said that they do have wifi so we hope to go back again for a mid day snack and lesson planning . Overall i am very pleased with this restaurant and i will be sure to return .
