I tried 50 $ course menu . Price itself is expensive but I can say it matches food quantity and quality . You can enjoy both local and Japanese seafood in a Japanese cooking way and can watch cooking in front of you over counter table .
Access is very good as this restaurant located on main street . I highly recommend this place if you really want to try genuine Japanese food .
