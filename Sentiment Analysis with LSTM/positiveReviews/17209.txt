Space : Space is really cute . Small and lovely with beautiful pictures of Vietnam and a lot of books - it feels a bit like your own living room .
Food : the hotpot with quails in it is described in one sentence : delicious with a litte bit awesome ! Price is quite cheap . Also for extra vegetables or beef the price is reasonable .
The_Service is very lovely , they don ' t speak a lot english though , but with hands and feet everything works perfect . The girls are funny and friendly .
I visit Vietland every time when in Hanoi .
