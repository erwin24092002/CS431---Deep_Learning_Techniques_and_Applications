The place was surprisingly elegant with a welcoming staff . The restaurant had a modern theme and the furniture were comfy . The food there was well presented and delicious . The quantity of the food given was a large amount and the price was unbelievably cheap ! The food was not what I expected to taste like ( it tastes the same as the vietnamese / thai food in canada ) .
There were many different varieties to chose from ; however I tried the special pho noodle soup ( pho dac biet ) . The deep fried chicken wings with thai sauce ( canh ga chien voi sauce thai lan ) was to die for !
I would completely recommend those items since I demolished my dishes .
I would give this restaurant a rating of 3.5 / 5 on presentation , 4/5 on food , and a 5/5 on service .
I would recommend this restaurant to everyone and especially to those who are willing to try new things !
