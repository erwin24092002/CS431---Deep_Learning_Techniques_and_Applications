It is called Ding_Ding , or scored , or winner ! Either way , the all you can eat hot pot is all of the above ! For 250K each it is not the cheapest but we ate our hearts out ! The tom yum soup base was quite nice although a slightly stronger flavour would have been better . Papaya salad was quite nice but there was no shrimps . A complimentary thai ice drink was quite ordinary as it was sour and syrupy ! They threw in a plate of fried goodies which were awesome though !
The all you can eat hot pot - the service was excellent and prompt , the food was quite nice except for the prawns which were tiny and really no point having it given it was soooo small !
However , everything was very nice and to finish off we ended up with 10 bowls of desserts all inclusive !
On a negative note , their air conditioning was terrible - you know your customers will order hot pot but the airflow was not strong enough and the air was not cold enough !
All in all , a wonderful dining experience with great customer service but let down by the dodgy air conditioning !
