I ' m not exaggerating ! Was here yesterday afternoon to see ( and taste ) for myself the truthfulness of their claims , and I was not disappointed !
Ordered a small matcha cheesecake and Susan got her big blueberry . They were rich , smooth and unbelievably delicious ! No flour / starchy tastes , no cake layers , no gelatine glaze - just pure cheesecake goodness !
Service was excellent too ! Staff_Tien was genuinely friendly and knew how to strike a conversation . And one of the 2 Aussie owners ( I guessed ) didn ' t mind chatting with us for a few minutes before receiving payment . They ' ve only opened 7 months ago and I wouldn ' t think twice going back ( with friends ) for more cheesecake tasting !
Well-deserved rating . Highly recommended .
