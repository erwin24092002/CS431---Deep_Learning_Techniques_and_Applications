Well , I must say I was very surprised to find steak of this quality in HCMC !
My first 2 " steak " experinces were really horrible for someone like myself , who happened to work at 1 of the San_Francisco_Bay_Areas best steakhouses called Alexander ' s Steakhouse ( actually had a Michelin for a couple years ) !
Steak_Deli happens to be in the same alley as where I just moved to recently and I had been putting off going here based on my other 2 experiences .
This is a husband ( Franch chef ) and wife ( Vietnamese ) team , she runs the dining room and waits tables .
I only tried the Australian_Ribeye on lava stone , about 350,000 VND for 250 grams ( $ 15USD ) , really good value ! It included a small side salad and fries , with a roll and choice of sauce . The lava stone does give it a nice flavor and they season the steak with salt , pepper and some herb mixture , but I personally would not want it again in the stone - I would rather have the kitchen just cook it for me next time .
Being from Califonia , especially San_Francisco , I am very used to having my choice of wines with steak . Unfortunately_Steak_Deli on has 2 wines available by the glass , 1 each red and white , both from the same winery in Chile . However , they did offer a Perrin_Chat . Du_Pape ! So far on my travels around HCMC the wine choices are very limited !
Overall , I liked Steak_Deli and wish them lots of luck !
