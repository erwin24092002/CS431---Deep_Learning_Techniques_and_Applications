In a free world , the overzealous drinks vendor is the most disgusting person going around .
We visited in the evening after tea , and there were numerous bunch of kids there snacking and having a drink .
So walking around the square and admiring the statue of Virgin_Mary and the Notre_Dame church , we had a look at what ' s around also in terms of snack .
We settled on a snack and made a purchase , and we sat down on the concrete edging to eat the snack when a female drinks vendor walked up and flashed me a drinks menu , which I kindly declined as I was going for coffee afterwards anyway .
The drinks vendor then goes ' well you can ' t sit here in that case '
I was absolutely god smacked as my understanding is that this is a public square and there is no right of anyone apart from the church to say who can sit and who can ' t .
So of course it was easier to move on rather than make a scene in front of the Virgin_Mary .
Absolutely terrible experience , the police needs to make a presence in the evening to clear those clowns up .
But this is a FREE_WORLD and you have no god damn right to determine who can sit in front of the church - go take your business elsewhere .
