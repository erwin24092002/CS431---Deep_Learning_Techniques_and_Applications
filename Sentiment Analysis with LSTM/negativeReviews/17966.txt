i went here for a small snack around 4pm . it is easy to find .
food : donuts are not nice at all . it was so cold and hard . the black coffee was ok . the mango shake was too sweet .
service : friendly
ambiance : clean and alot of tourist
price : medium
return : maybe , but only in the morning when the donuts are more fresh
