I just went to a wedding yesterday 4/16 at diamond hall at adora . The place is very pretty with all the decorations . However , there are few things that need to be improved upon
1 . Food : not even average . Food was too salty and not fresh . Btw , the wedding i went , each table was 8 trieu/ban .
2 . Stage looks good but the Music was too loud .
3 . MC was only announcing the beginning . She didnt keep the croud entertained throught out the party . On top of that , the band and singers of adora were bad !
Overall , not worth your money !
