Dont believe other reviewers . The dj doesnt do * but spin tracks off cd . I can do that at home . No creativity whatsoevet . The music sucks . Everything has the beat over and over . Try listening to the same trance beat for 3 hours and it will drive you insane . The atmosphere is anemic . No one really wants to get up and dance . Everyone is just sitting around just watching . So lame . Dont go here .
