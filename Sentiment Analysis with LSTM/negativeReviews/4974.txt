My brother and I had lunch here , I looks and felt like high - class fast food joint . We arrived here at 12pm noon .
Ambiance : seats were comfortable , tables and chairs were clean . I can see a lot of tourist and men ' s in suits here .
Service : the staff serving me were patient and friendly . But the food took 20mins to come . So much for fast food , it was not only me but other customers were complaining as well .
Food : The western bacon burger - my brother said he liked it .
Fries : it taste ok a bit warm , but for the wait I expected it to be hot .
Drinks : unlimited free refill .
Bbq chicken : it taste good but it didn ' t like taste grill or Bbq .
Price : ok
Return : maybe
