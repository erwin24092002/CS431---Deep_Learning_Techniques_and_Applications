A very pretty Cafe on a quiet street . Plenty of outdoor seating set in a lush garden . Limited indoor seating , but there is aircon inside . We were here at 10am and it was too hot to be outside . So we took 1 of the 6 tables inside .
Unfortunately the coffee wasn ' t very good on this visit . My wife ordered a cappuccino and it was weak with little flavor . I had my usual bac siu ( coffee with milk ) which had very little coffee .
So , would I return ? Probably not . If I do it would be to enjoy the garden at night . Not for the coffee .
