I ' m a Saigonian , living in HN . I ' m long for a dish of Com_Tam . I tried couple places and Com_Tam_Moc is one of them .
Com_Tam_Moc is already a well - known brand in Saigon but I guess they cannot keep the same quality when coming to Hanoi .
So disappointed , that ' s all I can say . Compare to Thuy_Linh_Chau , Thuy_Linh_Chau is much much better ( http : / / www.foody.vn/ha-noi/com-tam-thuy-linh-chau )
Food : it ' s nothing like com tam . Why ? Because of the rice . Everyone knows Com_Tam is made from broken rice . But here , they use normal type of rice , so the taste is no longer there .
I ordered Com_Tam_Suon , the meat was not actually grilled like it should be , but a fried one : (
Location : no comment , it ' s easy to find . Have place for parking .
Cost : for that quality of food , it doesnt worth my money .
Service and Staff : ok
