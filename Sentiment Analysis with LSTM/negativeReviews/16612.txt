We were at Buffet_Ganh last night and it was pretty crowded after 7pm . The services was good from the start and through out the night .
Foods with lots of selection to choose from and mainly tradiditional Vietnamese foods , however some of the dishes was cold and tasteless . Seafoods section was crowded so did not had a chance to try it out . Overall , Would NOT highly recommend this place though
