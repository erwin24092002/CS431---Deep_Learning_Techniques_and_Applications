I went by myself and had Thai iced tea , yam woon sen and beef massaman - all very basic Thai dishes . This is 1of 2 locations of a popular local upscale and over - priced fusion Thai place . Offerings are many of the staples of Thai cuisine you would see in any westernised style restaurant - but strangely over sauced , under-seasoned , under-whelming and over - priced as well .
Strangely they stuffed about 4-5 business cards of other places ( their own maybe ? ) in the check presenter when I paid for the bill .
Server did well , he probably saved the experience .
This was my 2nd . place to try Thai food in HCMC , both very disappointing . Very loud on the 2nd . floor when I was here .
