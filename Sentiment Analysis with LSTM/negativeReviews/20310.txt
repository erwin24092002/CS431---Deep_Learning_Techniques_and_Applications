There are not many options at the airport so i guess i should not be so harsh but i have to be consistent across my reviews .
Had to get some hydration so fetched a bottle of water and a iced milo - let me just say it was not much good for the price paid !
I mean , 20k for a bottle of water - i can get that for half the price at a 7 - 11 ! And iced milo - a few scoops here and a bit of water and ice !
So overall , nothing spectacular ! Thankfully did not blink at their ridiculously overpriced burgers !
