The selection of beer is quite good , but the rest is average . The decoration is boring , the service is lazy . Ordered some food and a beer and after getting my food i still had to wait for my beer ...
The music is way to loud to talk . I would enjoy drinking the good beers there but because of the loud music i prefere to spend my time and money in other beer garden .
