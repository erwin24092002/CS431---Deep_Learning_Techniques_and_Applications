So crowded here . You have to get in line and get an open spot to sit . The pho here isn ' t as good as that in Saigon . Just be prepared that no vegetables included . I think they add a tad too much MSG . The noodles aren ' t as soft as the ones in Saigon . No meatballs either . Overall , its average and a buit overpriced .
