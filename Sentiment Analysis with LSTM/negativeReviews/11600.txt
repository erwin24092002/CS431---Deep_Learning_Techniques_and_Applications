I usually Don ' t Write negative reviews . but I guess there is a first for everything .
I came here yesterday around lunch time with 2 other guest .
  Before entering the store , I saw a few people in the buffet , I looked at the sashimi and sushi from outside and they looked very declicuis .  
I went in sat down and order the buffet meal .
Drinks : Water melon Juice - very nice  
Gava_Juice ( oi ) - very nice
Foods : All the meats here had no flavour , I had to order chopped garlic on the side so I could dip the meat in it so there was some flavour . I also remember ordering   salt and pepper so I could dip the meats in it as well before cooking . For the price I paid , I expect there to be flavour in the meat .
Their_Sashimi_Plate outside was never refilled .   I remembering try to back for some sashimi Salmon but it was always gone .
Even the HOT_POT had no flavour . honestly for the price I had for the total meal which was around 1million Dong , it was not worth it .  
  Staff : they were friendly and fast with my orders .   I can not find a problem with them .
Ambiance : Outside and Interior was renovated very nicely , I can see the owner most of put alot of money into the place to dress it up . the shop was clean tables chairs floors were clean . Wifi here was slow though .
Return : no
Price : expensive
