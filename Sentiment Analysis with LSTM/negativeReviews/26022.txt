It was my 1st time and maybe the last time I came here ! ! ! It was just a terrible experience ... . I have known Vi_Thai for a long time , on To_Hien_Thanh and other streets as well .
Menu were quite okay , colorful and a lot of selections . Prices are quite high compared to Thai_Express , which is much better and more luxury than this .
Cant believe how bad service was as well , the staffs cannot explain what are differences between blue and red tea ... . ( mean the flavor ) .
We had to wait so long for the foods ( beef curry only ) .
Overall , high prices , bad services , not quality foods ... . . No more can I say !
