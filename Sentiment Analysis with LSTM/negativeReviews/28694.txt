I went here for a quick coffee and to get some work done for an hour . Ordered a Vietnamese_Ice_Coffee with Milk ( ca phe sua da ) for 50,000 d . When it arrived , it was not even close to what I believe ca phe sua da to be ( have been in Vietnam on - and-off for the past 6 years ) . It was essentially a shot of Vietnamese coffee , fresh milk , Korean sugar syrup and a hell of a lot of water .
Fair enough , it ' s a bad drink , so I asked them if they could re - make it as what everyone knows to be ca phe sua da . They refused and told me that ' s how they make it . Furthermore they told me I must not be familiar with the drink , and proceeded to speak about myself and this issue for the next 5 minutes , until I told them that I understood Vietnamese .
Anyway , the coffee was terrible and Â  staff were amazingly rude to a very non - confrontational foreigner . In a country where the coffee is great and the people are amongst the friendliest I ' ve ever met , I felt it was necessary to write this review .
