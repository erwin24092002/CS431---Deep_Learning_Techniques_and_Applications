My friend invited me to this restaurant for the 2nd time , and I ' m really disappointed .
My first time here , the soup was washy , lasagna was too salty , lemon juice was way too sour , and the pasta wasn ' t well done . Not to mention that the crab pasta was cold and smelled terribly fishy . I had a stomach pain after that meal .
My second experience is not so much better . Nothing but the salad tatses up to my standard . Lasagna was still too salty . Orange juice was literally squished orange and a separate cup of surgar , which was terribly sour AND sweet at the same time . Sorry to say this but that ' s not how a restaurant serves an expensive cup of orange juice , at least they should add water to lessen the sour taste . On the other side , the carrot juice was mixed with too much water , and tastes not much like carrot juice .
The worst dish I had today was the crab pasta ... It was even worse than the last time I tried it . The fishy smell was so overwhelming , I couldn ' t finish half of the dish , and puked right after getting home . I doubt if the smell was a sign of bad food preservation . I really hope not .
This is my 2nd and also my last time eating here ... The service was good , but the quality and price are different as night and day .
