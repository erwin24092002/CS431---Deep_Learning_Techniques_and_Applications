I ordered 1 X_GOLDMINE_CHEESECAKE 64 ' 900 â‚« It was delivery and they sent me what looked like a piece of left over dried up cheese cake that should have been put into garbage . I complained that there answer was " First of all , the restaurant ' s manager explained that nydc restaurants has changed their menus since August , therefore the Cheesecake you got is the new size of the new menu . It is also why you found it different from the one in your previous order on July . " So , they will continue to give mini tiny piece of garbage to customers .
