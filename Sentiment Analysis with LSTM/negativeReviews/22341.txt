This place is quite nice !
Flan gato is acceptable and almost the others are unauthentic ones i suppuse !
I called a tiramisu with chocolate flavor and it was the worst tiramisu i ' ve ever eaten .
Anyhow , I recommend this store for everyone who needs a place for hanging out with some sweetie & cake
