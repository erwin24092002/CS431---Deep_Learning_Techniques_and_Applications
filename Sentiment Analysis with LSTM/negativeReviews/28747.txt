From first glance it looked like a decent " binh dan " place , would definitely say its attractive to those that are looking for a good quality bowl of Pho . Very comfortable in seating choices and a moderately sized pho house . However , upon going in and receiving my bowl of Pho_Tai I was confused as to why the noodle isn ' t your typical " banh pho " but rather the silver noodles used in Hiu_Tieu style soup . All in all it was still a decent bowl of pho but the Hiu_Tieu noodles was a really strange twist . I wouldn ' t go again , however .
