I know it is hard to find a good kebab place in SG and this place proves Im right . First of all , the sauce is nothing like a real kebab sauce , but is some kind of liquidish melted fatty butter - like thing , so bad . The meat is ok , well seasoned ; however , using pork in a Turkish dish makes me uncomfortable ( but not very suprise since most of kebab places here in SG do the same thing ) . The vegetables are fresh . Biside of that , there is nothing good I say about this place . The staffs are all grumpy and impolite . Not recommended .
