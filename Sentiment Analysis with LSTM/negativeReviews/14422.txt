Rudest staff i have come across in Vietnam ! In addition to being rude , it took 30 minutes to get the meat to BBQ when the restaraunt was not even busy . Multuple times we try to get the attention of staff and they walk past and ignore us ! When we did get their attention they are rude ! ! Would never EVER recommend to eat here ! And will never ever return here !
