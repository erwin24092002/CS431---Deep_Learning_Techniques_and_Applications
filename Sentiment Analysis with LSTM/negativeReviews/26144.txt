Expensive because it is located at district 1 , however quality of food is not good , compared to price and other similar restaurant like Cucgach .
Fish pot is very salty , chicken salads is mentioned Vietnamese chicken but it is not .
Price of chicken on the menu is 190 , but when we came with 5 persons , they automatically double te food and price without asking for acceptance - > that i felt impolite and cheated and annoyed .
I will not come back here ! ! !
