A place where you could actually have a conversation without screaming . Its pretty spread out so you wont have to worry about getting bumped into some shorter Asian dude . The crowd here is a bit classier than that at Chill ( too many sluts there ) . Their drinks are a little less expensive than Chill ' s but still high for Vietnamese standard . The city view here is ok but not as cool as Chill ' s . Overall , a place worth visiting . Dont count on the music as they all suck in HCMC . They dont play anything else but trance and techno . Asian people have limited taste in music . Go figure .
