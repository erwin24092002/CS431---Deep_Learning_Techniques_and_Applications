We tried Lotus_Leaf_Restaurant because of the reviews . However , the food was only average and overly priced for average food . What made it worse is that the staff turned off the Air_Conditioning during our meal ( we were the only customers in the restaurant ) and the mosquitoes inside the restaurant were biting us . We got the bill while still eating and left , not eating all the food .
