Very nice space but overpriced for VN coffee ! Cause you have to add 10% VAT + 5% Service charge and they only use VN coffee which is basically the cheapest .
A cappuccino comes out 80K ! as expensive as Coffee_Bean / Starbucks which are imported coffee ( means tax ) .
Waitress I don ' t know why but did not smile , like we are bothering her ... not worth the service charge at all ! ! !
The waiter who came first was indeed professional and smile .
If waitresses do not like this job , they should go for another job . Simple as that .
