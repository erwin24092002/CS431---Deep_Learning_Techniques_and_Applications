I ' m not sure what service at this place is like on a normal day but on New_Year ' s Eve 2015 , they were charging 180,000 VND for a bottle of water . They even messed up our table booking and so we sat in a random corner with the view blocked by the trees . don ' t support businesses like this there are much better places in Vietnam .
