I had a very disappointing experience here . I had my waffles re - done twice , still it was really soft and not crispy at all , in an microwaved - frozen-waffle way . The panna cotta was average , while the pricing is pretty high considering their products ' quality . I ' m giving this place a better rating than it deserves only because the service was good .
