Location : You ' ll find this street corner mini open air restaurant through the back alleys of To_Hieu_Street . Originally wanted to eat elsewhere , but didn ' t have much time so we weren ' t picky . It would be very inconvenient finding this place , but it being at a corner makes it loads easier to find .
Space : No tables outside the building were seen so I bet most people eat inside . The place could probably serve 10 people , which is quite understandable since it probably doesn ' t get packed . But it ' s not decorated or beautiful , basic . Fine for daily dining if you just want to eat and get out . Though ... could be even distasteful since the place where they keep dirty dishes could be seen .
Quality : All 3 Vietnamese and I agreed that we ' ve had better . It ' s ok , but the flavor is lacking . 1 couldn ' t even finish and said he was full . The sauce isn ' t sweet compared to many I ' ve tried too . I was disappointed and never want to eat anything like this ... especially since I could probably find banh cuon nearby that ' s sooo much tastier . The egg banh cuon was also runny , didn ' t look cooked fully and someone ended up cutting around the edges and removing the yolk . Gross ...
Cost : Decent , but considering the quality ... Not good . No comment .
Service : Prepared at decent to quite nice timing , you don ' t have to wait long . The woman who served us was alright and gave us what we wanted . Nothing special .
