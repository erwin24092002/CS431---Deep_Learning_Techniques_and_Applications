Tonight is the 2nd worst experience at restaurant in Vietnam . Maybe i came here alone so not good customer . Order receipt look like paper were thrown to my table , curry i ordered was left to the table across from me , and by the time somebody realized that curry was mine , rice in claypot was already cold . No word from any of staff . Ordered 2nd beer and ice , i needed to ask for ice twice . Only about 10% of table were filled and should not be busy . I cannot recommend this place to anybody . Of course , i will not come to this place anymore .
