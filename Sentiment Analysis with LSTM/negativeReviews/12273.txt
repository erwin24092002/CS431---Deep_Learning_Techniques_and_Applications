First off , RuNam Bistro is extremely well designed . Whoever was responsible for the design and layout of the restaurant deserves some kind of award , because it ' s a really beautiful place and has a great atmosphere .
Unfortunately , the food doesn ' t follow suit . The menu seems to have been designed by someone who has travelled a bit , made a list of all their favourite dishes , and then thrown them all on the same menu . Definitely not put together by a chef , and sadly not cooked by chefs experienced with Western cuisine either .
We visited with 8 friends and tried numerous items off the menu . They ranged from average to bland - badly seasoned imported ingredients that were clearly frozen to begin with .
A nice place for drinks and desert ( the coffee is pretty good too ) , but the food is a big disappointment , especially if you ' re a Westerner .
