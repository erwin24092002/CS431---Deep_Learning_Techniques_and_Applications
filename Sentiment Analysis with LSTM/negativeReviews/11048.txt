I work in District 1 not far from Taco_King . Delivery was decent , only taking 30 minutes . Everything else was a disaster .
The photos on the menu are false advertising and the food looks nothing like it . We paid 30,000 dong per tostada which was missing the vegetables - it was only a small piece of fried bread the size of a big chip and a small cup of refried beans . We paid 55,000 per small burrito , but there were no vegetables or other dressings with it . We paid 30,000 per small taco , which also had no veggies and dressings - only meat and shell .
For the same price , you can go to a more popular Mexican restaurant and get an appetizer that is more filling . After spending about 100,000 dong each , we ' re still going out to get a lunch because it was not filling at all .
Picture 1 : They used so many little plastic containers for each tortilla ( the size of a chip ) and sauce
