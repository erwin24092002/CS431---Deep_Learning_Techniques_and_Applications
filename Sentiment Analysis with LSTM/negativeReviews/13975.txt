My friends and I wanted to go to bo ke which was reccomended by our hotel but our taxi driver brought us to another place . Firstly the servers were not helpful in taking our orders or any of our requests . Seeing that out table was full , the lady simply stacked a new dish on top of the previous dish without considering that we were not finished with that dish ( an omelette ) . Secondly , the food served were not only not fresh but inedible ! The squid was charred black . The fish was overcooked with its flesh stuck to the aluminum foils . The fish soup was utterly untouchable and the taste was horrid ! We ordered oysters but was served with what looked and tasted nothing like oysters ! The only thing edible was the omelette and the fried rice . Having such an awful experience , we wanted to feedback to the servers and management . However , they were not interested in our feedback at all and completely ignored us . With such bad attitude and bad food , we left even without finishing the meal . The meal was obviously overpriced paying 2.5million for 7pax . This place is a scam ! Do not visit !
