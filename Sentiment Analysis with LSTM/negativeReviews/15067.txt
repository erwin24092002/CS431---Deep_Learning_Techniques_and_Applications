Since we loved ramen , we went to this place to check it out . We didn ' t know what time the place opened & came 2 minutes before the store opened . The grumpy staff said they were getting ready . My wife asked if we can wait in the store & the unfriendly staff asked us to wait outside . Such bad service , as if they don ' t want to have our business !
