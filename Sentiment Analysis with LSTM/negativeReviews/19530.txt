... okay on the inside . I just came here because of all the reviews . I ' m visiting from Los_Angeles ( tough to beat ) . This place is definitely overhyped . I got the green tea ice cream , strawberry macaroon , matcha smoothie , and the strawberry brick toast . Everything was mediocre and I have definitely had better . The packaging of the items , the store cleanliness , and service was amazing ; this is half the experience . I wished the food was the same .
