I have known this place for several months and today I used Hotdeal voucher to have a try here .
It looked quite attractive from outside but not that attrative inside , quite simple and boring , I think .
It was nearly full when I came . After I ordered , I have to wait for a long time for foods . Waitress said that there were so many people and it took long time to prepare foods and I think they came because of the vouchers . Services were quite bad and slow ... . I have to ask for a knife to eat steak and I had to take tissue myself ! ! !
Foods are okay .
I ' m not sure whether I come back here ... .
