I came here for lunch , the eatery is a like the other takeaway restaurant . Parking and access was easy .
Food : boiled chicken : this is the only good food they had here .
Pork chops : not nice at all
Egg : overcooked
Broccoli : it wasn ' t fresh
Service : very slow , I had to call twice for my ice tea .
Ambiance : tables and chairs were clean .
Price : cheap
Return : maybe only because it was cheap and the chicken was cooked right
